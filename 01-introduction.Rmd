# Why Work Like a Software Engineer? 

First of all, because everybody and their grandmothers seem to do it. Statistical computing continues to be on the rise in many branches of research.

Second because it's reproducible. Code has become a tremendous communication channel. Your web scraper does not work? 
Instead of reaching out in a clumsy but wordy cry for help, posting what you tried so far described by source code will often get you good answers within hours on platforms like [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or [Crossvalidated](https://crossvalidated.com). Or think of feature requests: After a little code ping pong with the package author your wish eventually becomes clearer. Let alone chats with colleagues and co-authors. Sharing code just works. 
Academic journals have found that out, too in the meantime. Many outlets require you to make the data and source code behind your work available. [Social Science Data Editors](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/template-README.html) is a bleeding edge project at the time of writing this, but is already referred to by top notch journals like American Economic Review (AER). 

Third, because it scales and automates. Automation is not only convenient. Like when you want to download data, process and create the same visualization and put it on your website any given Sunday. Automation is inevitable. Like when you have to gather daily updates from different outlets or work through thousands of .pdfs. 

Last but not least because of things you couldn't do w/o being an absolute guru (if at all) if wasn't for programming. Take  visualization. Go, check [these D3 Examples](https://d3js.org/). Now, try to do that in Excel. If you do these things in Excel it'd make you an absolute spreadsheet visualization Jedi, probably missing out on other time consuming skills to master. Moral of the story is, with decent, carpentry level programming skills -- that'd be the upfront investment -- you can already do so many spectular things while not really specializing and staying very flexible. 



## How to Read this Book? 

The focal goal of this book is to map out the open source stack, identify neuralgic components and give you an idea of how to improve not only in programming but also in navigating the wonderful but vast open source ecosystem. Chapter 2 is the roadmap for this book: it describes and classifies the different parts of the open source stack and explains how these pieces relate to each other. Subsequent chapters highlight core elements of the open source toolbox one at a time and walk through applied examples mostly written in the R language.   

This book is a companion. The companion I wish I had when I started an empirical, data intersive PhD in economics. Yet, the book is written years after said PhD was completed and with the hindsight of 10+ years in academia. *Programming with Data* is written based on the experience of helping students and seasoned researchers of different fields with their data management, processing and communication of results.

If you are confident in your ambition to amp up your programming to at least [solid software carpentry level]() within the next few months, I suggest to get an idea of your starting point relative to this book.The upcoming *backlog* section is essentially a list of suggested to-dos  on your way to solid software carpentry. Obviously, you may have cleared a few tasks of its backlog item before even reading this boo which is fine.  On the other hand you might know about some of the things that are listed in the *requirement* section which is fine, too. The backlog and requirements mean to give you some orientation. 
 
If you do not feel committed, revisit the previous section, discuss the need for programming with peers from your domain and possibly talk to a seasoned R or Python programmer. Motivation and commitment are key for endurance needed to develop programming into a skill that truly leverage your domain specific expertise. 


## Backlog

Other than the classification and overview that *Programming with Data* provides, its introduction to **git version control** and the **collaboration workflow associated with git** are likely the most impactful items on your backlog. If you are not familiar with commits, pulls, pushes, branches, forks and pull requests, *Programming with Data* will open up a new world by introducing you to industry standard collaboration. A solid *git* foundation makes you fit into plethora of (software) teams around the globe -- in academia in beyond.
