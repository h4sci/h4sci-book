What You Need to Know to Make the Most of This Book

Though the book offers many entry points and strives to make advanced considerations accessible, 
*Programming with Data* provides the most value for readers whose prior knowledge is beyond certain threshold. The book is **not** an introduction to R nor Python. It's **not** an introduction to data science or machine learning either. Neither knowledge is strictly required to follow the book, but a basic understanding of statistical methods and the challenges applied statisticians face certainly helps to motivate getting invested into programming. Likewise, prior knowledge of a *scripting language* like *R, Python* or *Javascript*, *git version control*, as well as familiarity with  *console / terminal basics* will help the reader sail smoothly. Still though, to self-reflect on one's starting point remains the most important requirement to leverage the book. 

*Programming with Data* willingly accepts to be overwhelming at times. Given the variety of topics touched in an effort to show the big picture, I encourage the reader to remain relaxed about a few blanks even when it comes to fundamentals. The open source community offers plenty of great resources to selectively upgrade skills and this books intends to show how to evaluate the need for help and how to find the right sources. 

*Programming with Data* was written with the idea in mind that well maintained open source projects are the best to document themselves. Therefore I rather reference to existing documentation as opposed to rewriting it. Because even if my wording was better than the original, it is only a matter of time before my documentation is outdated. The bigger the stack the harder to keep track. So whenever, you stumble upon something you do not understand, make sure to look it up. (I tried hard to provide good a glossary and reference wherever possible, but if not - still push yourself to look things up). 

That being said, to have an idea about following technologies and ideas will certainly help to get the most out of spending time with *Programming with Data*: 

- Basic R or Python 
- basic understanding of git version control 
- basic understanding of GitHub based workflows, e.g., issue tracker, kanban boards... 
- Terminal / Console and Shell and a shell, e.g., bash, fish

In other words: if none of the above means something to you, I recommend to make yourself comfortable with the basics of 2-3 of the above fields before you start to read this book or just cherry pick single topics.






# Developer Practices & Workflows

Just like most experienced engineers, seasoned software developers follow some kind of school or paradigm. Good programmers can even switch among approaches according to their current project's needs or depending on the team they are on. 

This section does not want to give a comprehensive overview over programming concepts nor compare approaches. And damn sure it does not mean to go to war over approach superiority. *Hacking for Social Scientists* rather cherry-picks suitable application-minded, low-barrier concepts that help social scientists professionalize their own programming. 


## Peer Programming

Peer programming, also called pair programming just means two developers sit in front of the same screen to collaborate on a piece of code. So why is there such a buzz about it? Why is there even a term for it? And why is there a section in an applied book on it? 

That is because novice programmers (and their scientific supervisors) often doubt the efficiency of two paid persons working at the same work station. But programming is not about digging a hole with two shovels. Particularly not when it comes to building the software basis or frame of a project. 

Working together using one single keyboard and screen or the virtual equivalent thereof can be highly efficient. The virtual equivalent, i.e., in fact using two computers but sharing the screen while in call, helps tremendously with a) your concept, b) your documentation. Plus, it is a code review at the same time. But most importantly both developers learn from each other. Having to explain and being challenged, deepens the understanding of experienced developers and ruthlessly identifies holes in one's knowledge. One important advice when peer programming is to switch the driver's seat from time to time. Make sure the lesser programmer holds the keys from time to time and maneuvers through articles, repositories, code and data. Doing so prevents the co-pilot from taking a back seat and letting the veteran do the entertainment. [Visual Studio Code Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) is a great feature for next level virtual peer programming as it allows for two drivers using two cursors.


Of course there are downsides of the pair programming approach, too. Also, timing within the lifecycle of a project is an important factor and not every project is the same fit for this agile method. But given there are so many approaches, I will leave the back and forth to others. The goal of this section is to point the reader to a practical approach that tends to work well in programming with data setups in social sciences. Googlers Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat had its fair of success, too, according to the New Yorker's [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge](The Friendship That Made Google Huge).  



## RSA Key Pair Authentication

This section could be headed 'log in like a developer'. RSA Key Pairs are a convenient, relatively secure way to log into an account. SSH based connections, including secure copy (SCP), often make use of RSA Key Pairs instead of using a combination of username and password. Also, most git platforms use this form of authentication. The basic idea of key pairs is to have a public key and a private key. While the private key is never shared with anyone, the public key is shared with any server you want to log in to.
It's like getting a custom door for any house that you are allowed to enter: share your public key with the server admin / or web portal and you'll be allowed in when you show your private key. In case you loose your private key or suspect it has been stolen, simply inform the admin, so she can remove the door (the public key). This is were a little detail comes into play: 
you can password protect the authentication process. Doing so buys you time to remove the key from the server before your password gets bruteforced. The downside of this additional password is its need for interaction. So when you are setting up a batch that talks to a remote server that is when you do *not* want a key /w password. 

Step one en route to log in like a grown up, is the create an RSA key pair. Github has a [1-2-3 type of manual](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to get it done. Nevertheless, I would like the R Studio (Server) specific way here. 

1. Login to https://teaching.kof.ethz.ch/ (or use your local R Studio Desktop)
2. Go to *Tools* -> *Global Options* -> *Git/SVN*
3. Hit Create RSA KEY (When you some crazy ASCII art reminiscant of a rabbit, it's just ok.)
4. Click 'View Public Key' 
5. Copy this key to the your clipboard. 

<img src="images/rsa.png">
<div class="caption-left">The R Studio GUI is an easy way to create an RSA Key Pair.</div> 

6. You can paste the key you obtained to your Github settings or put it into your server's authorized keys file. 

Congrats you may log in now! 


## Git Version Control 101

As stated before, version control may be the single most important thing to take away from *Hacking for Social Sciences*. 
In this chapter about the way developers work, I will stick to version control with *git*. The stack discussion of the previous chapter features a few more version control systems, but given git's dominant position, we will stick solely to git in this introduction to version control.  

### What is Git Version Control? 

Git is a decentralized version control system. It manages different versions of your source code (and other text files) in a simple but efficient manner that has become the industry standard: The git programm itself is a small console programm that creates and manages a hidden folder inside the folder you put under version control (you know those folders with a leading dot in their foldername, like .myfolder). This folder keeps track of all differences between the current version and other versions before the current one. 

<img src="images/commits.png" width="300px">
<div class="caption-half">Meaningful commit messages help to make sense of a project's history.</div>


The key to appreciate the value of git is to appreciate the value of semantic versions. Git is *not* Dropbox nor Google Drive. It does *not* sync automagically (even if some Git GUI Tools suggest so). Because these GUIs tools^[[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), Atlassian's [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and [Tortoise](https://tortoisegit.org/) are some of the most popular choices if you are not a console person.] may be convenient but do not really help to improve your understanding of the workflow, we will use the git console throughout this book. As opposed to the sync approaches mentioned above, a version control system allows to summarize a contribution across files and folders based on what this contribution is about. Assume you got a cool pointer from an econometrics professor at a conference and you incorporated her advice in your work. That advice is likely to affect different parts of your work: your text and your code. As opposed to syncing each of these files based on the time you saved them, version control creates a version when you decide to bundle things together and to commit the change. That version could be identified easily by its commit message 'incorporated advice from Anna (discussion at XYZ Conf 2020)'. 


### Why Use Version Control in Research? 

>A version control based workflow is a path to your goals that rather consists of semantically relevant steps instead of semantically meaningless chunks based on the time you saved them. 

In other more blatant, applied words: naming files like 
`final_version_your_name.R` or `final_final_correction_collaboratorX_20200114.R` 
is like naming your WiFi `dont_park_the_car_in_the_frontyard` or `be_quiet_at_night` to communicate with your neighbors.  Information is supposed to be sent in a message, not a file name. With version control it is immediately clear what the most current version is - no matter the file name. No room for interpretation. No need to start guessing about the delta between the current version and another version.

Also, you can easily try out different scenarios on different branches and merge them back together if you need to. Version control is a well established industry standard in software development. And it is relatively easy to adopt. With datasets growing in size and complexity, it is only natural to improve management of the code that processes these data. 

Academia has probably been the only place that would allow you to dive into hacking at somewhat complex problems for several years w/o ever taking notice of version control. As a social scientist who rather collaborates in small groups and writes moderate amount of code, have you ever thought about how to collaborate with 100+ persons in a big software project? Or to manage ten thousands of lines of code and beyond? Version control is an important reason why these things work. And it's been around for decades. But enough about the rant... 


### How Does Git Work ? 


>This introduction tries narrow things down to the commands that you'll need if want to use git in similar fashion to what you learn from this book. If you are looking for more comprehensive, general guides, three major git platforms, namely Atlassian's Bitbucket, GitHub and Gitlab offer comprehensive introductions as well as advanced articles or videos to learn git online.


The first important implication of decentralized version control is that all versions are stored on the local machines of every collaborator, not just on a remote server (this is also a nice, natural backup of your work). So let's consider a single local machine first.

<img src="images/decentralized.png" width="700px">
<div class="caption-half"></div>

Locally, a git repository consists of a *checkout* which is also called current *working copy* soon. This is the status of the file that your file explorer or your editor will see when you use them to open a file. To checkout a different version, one needs to call a commit by its unique commit hash and checkout that particular version. 

If you want to add new files to version control or bundle changes to some existing files into a new commit, add these files to the staging area, so they get committed next time a commit process is triggered. Finally committing all these staged changes under another commit id a new version is created. 


### Moving Around

So let's actually do it. Here's a three stage walk through of git commands that should have you covered in most use cases a researcher will face. Note that git has some pretty good error message that guess what could have gone wrong. Make sure to read them carefully. Even if you can't make sense of them, your online search will be a lot more efficient when you include these messages. 

**Stage 1: Working Locally**

```{r, eval=TRUE,message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
d <- data.frame("Command" = c("git init",
                              "git status",
                              "git add file_name.py",
                              "git commit -m 'meaningful msg'",
                              "git log",
                              "git checkout some-commit-id",
                              "git checkout main-branch-name"),
                "Effect" = c("put current directory and all its subdirs under version control.",
                             "shows status",
                             "adds file to tracked files",
                             "creates a new version/commit out of all staged files",
                             "show log of all commit messages on a branch",
                             "go to commit, but in detached HEAD state",
                             "leave temporary state, go back to last commit"),
                
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(d,"html",escape= FALSE)

```


**Stage 2: Working with a Remote Repository**

Though git can be tremendously useful even without collaborators, the real fun starts
when working together. The first step en route to get others involved is to add a remote repository. 


```{r, eval=TRUE,message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
d <- data.frame("Command" = c("git clone",
                              "git pull",
                              "git push",
                              "git fetch",
                              "git remote -v",
                              "git remote set-url origin https://some-url.com"),
                "Effect" = c("creates a new repo based on a remote one",
                             "get all changes from a linked remote repo",
                             "deploy all commit changes to the remote repo",
                             "fetch branches that were created on remote",
                             "show remote repo URL",
                             "set URL to remote repo"),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(d,"html",escape= FALSE)

```

**Stage 3: Branches**

Branches are derivatives from the main branch that allow to work on different feature at the same time
without stepping on someone elses feet. Through branch repositories can actively maintain different states. 


```{r, eval=TRUE,message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
d <- data.frame("Command" = c("git checkout -b branchname",
                              "git branch",
                              "git checkout branchname",
                              "git merge branchname"),
                "Effect" = c("create new branch named branchname",
                             "show locally available branches",
                             "switch to branch named branchname",
                             "merge branch named branchname into current branch"
                ),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(d,"html",escape= FALSE)

```




**Fixing Merge Conflicts** 

In most cases *git* is quite clever and can figure out which is the desired state of 
a file when putting two versions of it together. When git's *recursive strategy* is possible, git
it wil merge versions automatically. When the same lines were affected in different versions, git cannot tell 
which line should be kept. Sometimes you would even want to keep both changes. 

But even in such scenario fixing the conflict is easy. Git will tell you that your last command
caused a merge conflict and which files are conflicted. Open these files and see all parts of the file that
are in question. 

<img src="images/merge_conflict.png">
<div class="caption-left">Ouch! We created a conflict by editing the same line in the same file on different branches and trying to but these branches back together.</div>

Luckily git marks the exact spot where the conflict happens. Good text editors / IDEs 
ship with cool colors to highlight all our options. 

<img src="images/sublime_conflict.png">
<div class="caption-left">go for the current status or take what's coming in from the a2 branch?</div>

Some of the fancier editors even have git conflict resolve plugins that let you walk through all conflict points. 

<img src="images/vscode_conflict.png">
<div class="caption-left">In VS Code you can even click the option.</div>

At the and of the day, all do the same, i.e., remove the unwanted part including all the marker gibberish. 
After you have done so, save, commit and push (if you are working with a remote repo) . Don't forget to make sure you kinked out ALL conflicts.  



## Feature Branches, PRs and Forks

This section discusses real world collaboration workflows of modern open source software developers. 
Hence the prerequisites are a bit different in order to benefit the most from this section. Make sure you are past
being able to describe and explain git basics, be able to create and handle your own repositories. 

If you had only a handful of close collaborators so far, you may be fine with staying on the main branch and trying
not to step on each others feet. This is reasonable because it is not useful to work asynchronously 
on exact the same lines of code anyway. Nevertheless, there is a reason why *feature-branch-based* workflows became 
very popular among developers: Imagine you collaborate less synchronously, maybe with someone in another timezone. Or with a colleague who works on your project, but in a totally different month during the year. Or, most obviously, we someone you have never met. Forks and *feature-branch-based* workflows is the way a lot of modern open source projects are organized. 

Forks are just a way to contribute via feature branches even in case you do not have write access to a repository. But let's just have look at the basic case in which you are part of the team first. Assume there is already some work done, some version of the project is already up on GitHub. You join as a collaborator and are allowed to push changes now. It's certainly not a good idea to simply add things without review to a project's production. Like if you got access to modify the institute's website and you made your first changes and all of a sudden the website looks like this:

<div class="yellow">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="pink">
It used to be subtle and light gray. I swear!
</div>

Bet everybody on the team took notice of the new team member by then. In a feature branch workflow you would start from the latest production version. Remember, git is decentralized and you have all versions of your team's project. Right at your fingertips on your local machine. Create a new branch named indicative of the feature you are looking to work on. 

```
git checkout -b colorways
```

You are automatically being switched to the freshly created branch. Do your thing now. It could be just a single commit, or several commits by different persons. Once you are done, i.e., commited all changes, add your branch to the remote repository by pushing.  

```
git push -u origin colorways
```

This will add a your branch called *colorways* to the remote repository. If you are on any major git platform with your project, it will come with a decent web GUI. Such a GUI is the most straight forward way to do the next step: get your Pull Request (PR) going.

<img src="images/pr.png" width="700px">
<div class="caption-left">Github pull request dialog: Select the *pull request*, choose which branch you merge into which target branch.</div>

As you can see, git will check whether it is possible to merge automatically w/o interaction. Even if that is not possible, you can still issue the pull request. When you create the request you can also assign reviewers, but you could also do so at a later stage. 

```{block, type='note'}

**Note**, even after a PR was issued you can continue to add commits to the branch about to be merged. 
As long as you do not merge the branch through the Pull Request, commits are added to the branch. In other 
words your existing PR gets updated. This is a very natural way to account for reviewer comments. 

```


```{block2, type='note'}
**Pro-Tipp**: 
Use commit messages like 'added join to SQL query, closes #3'. The key word 'closes' or 'fixes', will automatically close issues referred to when merged into the main branch.

```

Once the merge is done, all your changes are in the main branch and you and everyone else can pull the main branch that now contains your new feature. Yay!


## Project Management Basics

The art of stress free productivity as I once called it in '10 blog post, has put a number of gurus on the map and whole strand of literature to our bookshelves. So rather than adding to that, I would like to extract a healthy, best-of-breed type of dose here. The following few paragraphs do not intend to be comprehensive -- not even for the scope of software projects, but inspirational. 

In tje software development startup community, the *waterfall* approach became synonym to conservative, traditional and ancient: Overspecification in advance of the project, premature optimization and a lawsuit over expectations that weren't met. Though waterfall project may be better than their reputation and specifications should not be too detailed and rigid.

Many software projects are rather organized in *agile* fashion with SCRUM and KANBAN being the most popular derivatives. 
Because empirical academic projects have a lot in common with software projects inasmuch that there is a certain expectation and quality control, but the outcome is not known in advance. Essentially in agile project management you roughly define an outcome along the lines of a minimum viable product (MVP). That way you do not end up with nothing after a year of back and forth. 
During the implementation you'd meet regularly, let's say every 10 days, to discuss development since the last meet and what short term plans for the next steps ahead. The team picks splits work into task items on the issue tracker and assigns them.  Solution to problems will only be sketched out and discussed bilaterally or in small groups. By defining the work package for only a short timespan, the team stays flexible. In professional setups agile development is often strictly implemented and makes use of sophisticated systems of roles that developers and project managers can get certified for. 

Major git platforms ship with a decent, carpentry level project management project management GUI. The issue tracker is at the core of this. If you use it the minimal way, it's simply a colorful to-do list. Yet, with a bit of inspiration and use of tags, comments and projects, an issue tracker can be a lot more

<img src="images/issue.png">
<div class="caption-left">The Github issue tracker (example from one of the course's repositories) can be a lot more than a todo list.</div>

Swimlanes (reminiscant of a bird's eye view of an Olympic pool) can be thought of columns that you have to walk through
from left to right: To Do, Doing, Under Review, Done. (you can also customize the number and label of lanes and event associate actions with them, but let's stick to those basic lanes in this section.) The idea is to use to keep track of the process and making the process transparent. 


<img src="images/swim.png">
<div class="caption-left">GitHub's web platform offers swimlanes to keep a better overview of issues being worked on.</div>

```{, type='note'}
**Tipp**: 
No lane except 'Done' should contain more than 5-6 issues. 
Doing so prevents clogging the lanes at particular stage which 
could potentially lead to negligent behavior, e.g., careless reviews. 

```





## Testing

When talking about development practices, testing can't be missing. So, just you know that I thought of this, tbc ...
